career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      An IT genius, who has become a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. I have a passion for software development and a knack for learning new technologies. I have a strong background in software development, but have also worked with IT infrastructure and management.
      I have a strong focus on accessibility and user experience, and have contributed to several open-source projects in this area. Lately I have been deep-diving into DevOps and DevEx, making lives easier for developers and users alike. I am a strong team player and have a gift for leading and inspiring others around me.
      Few CTOs have the same hands-on experience as I do (as my GitHub profile reveals), and I am not afraid to give a helping hand where needed. I am a strong believer in the power of open-source and sharing of knowledge, and I am always looking for ways to improve myself and the world around me.
