career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      An IT genius, who has become a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, but also master of some!  
      I have a passion for best-practice software development and a knack for picking up new technologies. I have experience with all parts of software development, but have also worked extensively with IT infrastructure and management.  
      With a strong focus on accessibility and user experience, I always try to deliver the best possible solutions and value for the end-users.  
      Lately I'm deep-diving into DevOps and DevEx, trying to make lives easier for developers and users alike. I'm a strong team player and have a gift for leading and inspiring others around me. Few CTOs have my hands-on experience (see GitHub profile), which gives me the ability to step in and help wherever it's needed the most, be it systems design, CI/CD pipelines or hands-on programming.  
      I'm always looking for ways to improve myself and the world around me.
